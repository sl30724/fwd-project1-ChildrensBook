    <h1>Has Gender Representation in Children's Books Improved Overtime?</h1>
    <div id="intro">
    <p>This data visualization project displays the data from the 2021 study, <a
        href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260566#pone-0260566-g005">60 years of
        gender representation in children's books</a>. Their data provides an up-to-date estimate of the relative
      proportion of
      males and females featured as single protagonists in 3,280 children’s books (0–16 years) published between
      1960–2020.

      <p>Their data shows that the proportion of female protagonists has increased over this 60-year period, even though
        male protagonists remain overrepresented even in recent years.<br>
        But has the gender representation in children's books really improved?</p>

      <p>When we look at different chategory of children's books. We can see some categories have a less equal gender representation even in recent years.
        For example, protagonists in <span class = "green">non-fiction</span> children's books have almost always been overrepresented as male.</p>
