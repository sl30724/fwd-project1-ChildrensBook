# Reflection Intro
In this project, I've completed all the goals I set in milestone 1:
- Using p5.js or three.js to visualiza data in an interesting way.
- Using Typed.js to create text animation.
- Using GSAP for cool scrolling effects.
- Some kind of interaction that allows users to interact with the data.

# Tools and Skills I Learned
### p5js Instance Mode
I've only made sketches on p5js online editor before, this project gave me the opportunity to learn how to use instance mode to incorporate multiple sketches, and ensure they're compatible with other javascript libraries used in this project.

### Multiple js files
It's the first time for me to use more than one javascript file in a web project, although there are definitely more things I have to learn on this topic.

### Improved understanding and proficiency in using object-oriented javascript
I've made my code highly reusable in this project by using Class, which I think is my biggest accomplishment in this project.

However, there are definitely room for improvement on both my creative and technical approach.
Below is what I'd do differently for my next project.

# Challenges
I was able to overcome almost all my challenges in the early stage of my project. However, once I was at the stage I was satisfied with, my motivation went down and didn't have much willpower to learn about GSAP as much as I wanted to. With that being said, I think there are a few things I could do differently in my next project to help with this issue.

# Takeaways
- Design first: I was worried about the project timeframe and didn't really sketch out or make a decent prototype of my project. But I believe having a design would guide me through this project better without the feeling of "ok, what's next?"
- Task list: Have a to-do list with this project. Really put down what I need to do and the expected timeline for each task.
- Learn 1 hard thing and 1 easy thing: Easy thing can boost confidence, while the hard thing provides enough challenges.
