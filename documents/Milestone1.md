# About This Project
A website that explores the issue of imbalanced gender representation in children's books with interaction, animation, 
and easy-to-read data visualization using [this 2021 study by Casey K, Novick K, Lourenco SF](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260566#pone-0260566-g005).
The intended audience of this website would be educators and those who are interested in gender issues.

# Inspiration
I recall myself being shocked reading [this essay](https://electricliterature.com/the-golden-ratio-of-sexism-in-childrens-literature/) a few years ago.
The golden ratio speaks of the author's observation that for every smart, brave, adventurous fictional girl character in children's books, the author must supply 1.618 boys.
I never realized the books I read growing up all have an imbalanced gender representation to an extent until then.
Therefore, I want to create an experience that gives the audience a similar "epiphany" moment.
And since reading essays and studies might not be everyone's cup of tea, I want to make this experience as fun as possible.

# Use of Javascript
- Greensock(GSAP) for scrolling animation.
- Typed.js for text animation.
